My name is Prashant Sharma. I'm an cloud architect, software engineer and AI enthusiast. I'm originally from Delhi, India, but I moved to Bengaluru in 2023.
I love all foods, particularly India food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of mushrooms. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.
